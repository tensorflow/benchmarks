# Introduction

PerfZero is a benchmark framework for Tensorflow. It intends to address the
following use-cases:

1) For user who wants to execute Tensorflow test to debug performance
regression.

PerfZero makes it easy to execute the pre-defined test by consolidating the
docker image build, GPU driver installation, Tensorflow installation, benchmark
library checkout, data download, system statistics collection, benchmark metrics
collection, profiler data collection and so on into 2 to 3 commands. This allows
developer to focus on investigating the issue rather than setting up the test
environment.

2) For user who wants to track the performance change of Tensorflow for a
variety of setup (e.g. GPU model, cudnn version, Tensorflow version)

The developer can setup periodic job to execute these benchmark methods using
PerfZero. PerfZero will collect the information needed to identify the
benchmark (e.g. GPU model, Tensorflow version, dependent library git hash), get
benchmark execution result (e.g. wall time, accuracy, succeeded or not),
summarize the result in a easy-to-read json string and upload the result to
bigquery table. Using the data in the bigquery table, user can then visualize
the performance change in a dashboard, compare performance between different
setup in a table, and trigger alert on when there is performance regression.




# Instructions for PerfZero user

Here are instructions for users who want to run benchmark method using PerfZero.


## Build docker image

The command below builds the docker image named `temp/tf-gpu` which contains the
libraries (e.g. Tensorflow) needed for benchmark.

```
python3 benchmarks/perfzero/lib/setup.py
```

Optional flag values:

1) Use `--dockerfile_path=docker/Dockerfile_ubuntu_1804_tf_v2` to build docker image for Tensorflow v2


## Run benchmark

The command below executes the benchmark method specified by `--benchmark_methods`:

```
export ROOT_DATA_DIR=/data

nvidia-docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -v $ROOT_DATA_DIR:$ROOT_DATA_DIR temp/tf-gpu \
python3 /workspace/benchmarks/perfzero/lib/benchmark.py \
--gcloud_key_file_url="" \
--git_repos=https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git \
--python_path=models \
--data_downloads="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz" \
--benchmark_methods=official.resnet.estimator_cifar_benchmark.EstimatorCifar10BenchmarkTests.unit_test \
--root_data_dir=$ROOT_DATA_DIR
```

`${ROOT_DATA_DIR}` should be the directory which contains the dataset files
required by the benchmark method. If the flag `--data_downloads` is specified,
PerfZero will download files from the specified url to the directory specified
by the flag `--root_data_dir`. Otherwise, user needs to manually download and
move the dataset files into the directory specified by `--root_data_dirs`. The
default `root_data_dir` is `/data`

Here are a few useful optional flags. Run `python3 benchmark.py --help` to see
detailed documentation for each flag.

1) Use `--workspace=unique_workspace_name` if you need to run multiple benchmark
using different workspace setup. One example usecase is that you may want to
test a branch from a pull request without changing your existing workspace.

2) Use `--debug` if you need to see the debug level logging

3) Use `--git_repos="git_url;git_branch;git_hash"` to checkout a git repo with
the specified git_branch at the specified git_hash to the local folder with the
specified folder name.  Specify the flag once for each repository you want to
checkout.  Note that we added `"` in the `--git_repos` value string so that `;`
will not be interpreted by the bash as the end of the command.

5) Use `--profiler_enabled_time=start_time:end_time` to collect profiler data
during period `[start_time, end_time)` after the benchmark method execution
starts. Skip `end_time` in the flag value to collect data until the end of
benchmark method execution. Run `tensorboard
--logdir=perfzero/workspace/output/${execution_id}` or `python3 -m
tensorboard.main --logdir=perfzero/workspace/output/${execution_id}` to open
Tensorboard server. If PerfZero is executed on a remote machine,
run `ssh -L 6006:127.0.0.1:6006 remote_ip` before opening `http://localhost:6006`
in your browser to access the Tensorboard UI.

## Understand benchmark summary

PerfZero outputs a json-formatted summary that provides the information needed
to understand the benchmark result. The summary is printed in the stdout and
logged in file under the directory
`path_to_perfzero/${workspace}/output/${execution_id}`. It is also uploaded to
bigquery in Google Cloud when `--bigquery_dataset_table_name` is specified.

Here is an example output from PerZero. Explanation is provided inline for each
key when the name of the key is not sufficiently self-explanary.

  }
}
```

# Instructions for benchmark developer

Here are the instructions that developers of benchmark method needs to follow in
order to run benchmark method in PerfZero.

1) The benchmark class should extend the Tensorflow python class
[tensorflow.test.Benchmark](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/platform/benchmark.py). The benchmark class constructor should have a
constructor with signature `__init__(self, output_dir)`. Benchmark method
should put all generated files (e.g. logs) in `output_dir` so that PerfZero can
upload these files to Google Cloud Storage when `--output_gcs_url` is specified.
See [EstimatorCifar10BenchmarkTests](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/resnet/estimator_cifar_benchmark.py) for example.

2) At the end of the benchmark method execution, the method should call [report_benchmark()](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/platform/benchmark.py)
with the following parameters:

```
tf.test.Benchmark.report_benchmark(
  iters=num_iteration,         # The number of iterations of the benchmark.

  wall_time=wall_time_sec,     # Total wall time in sec for all iterations.

  extras={                     # key/value pairs for arbitrary metrics where key is the name of the metric and value can be either string or double.

      'accuracy': 99.5,        # If the value is double, it is used as the value of the metric.

      'accuracy_top_5': {      # If the value is string, it should be a json-formatted string with the following fields.
        'value': 80,           # This is used as the value of the metric
        'succeeded': True      # Optional. Whether the metric passes developer-defined requirement. This is used by PerfZero to report whether benchmark has succeeded.
        'min_value': 80        # Optional. Lower bound for the metric value to succeed. Used to tell user why the benchmark has failed.
        'min_value': 100       # Optional. Upper bound for the metric value to succeed. Used to tell user why the benchmark has failed.
      }
  }
)
```

This format allows PerfZero to specify whether the benchmark has succeeded
(e.g.  for convergence test) in its summary based on the logic determined by
the benchmark developer.


3) Include dependent libraries in `--git_repos` and `--python_path`. These
libraries will be checked-out in the directory
`path_to_perfzero/workspace/site-packages` by default. Developer can edit these
libraries directly and execute benchmark with the local change.


# Instructions for PerfZero developer


Avoid importing `tensorflow` package in any place that requires the `logging`
package because tensorflow package appears to prevent logging from working
properly. Importing `tensorflow` package only in the method that requires it.

Here are the commands to run unit tests and check code style.

```
# Run all unit tests
# This must be executed in directory perfzero/lib
python3 -B -m unittest discover -p "*_test.py"

# Format python code in place
find perfzero/lib -name *.py -exec pyformat --in_place {} \;

# Check python code format and report warning and errors
find perfzero/lib -name *.py -exec gpylint3 {} \;
```

Here is the command to generate table-of-cotents for this README. Run this
command and copy/paste it to the README.md.

```
./perfzero/scripts/generate-readme-header.sh perfzero/README.md
```
