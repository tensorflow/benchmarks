CPU benchmark targets:

cpu_benchmark (~900s): Generate a random named k8s cluster on tensorflow testing
cpu_benchmark_with_cluster (~300s): use existing
"cpu_benchmark-permanent-cluster" on tensorflow testing.

Note: If we want to create a new permanent cluster, use the first target,
change CLUSTER in cpu_prepare.sh to the new name, and comment the delete
cluster command in teardown.sh


GPU benchmark targets:

token_print (~500s): Generate a k8s cluster token and upload to gcs bucket
rbe-tensorflow-benchmarks.
gpu_benchmark (>2500s): Generate a new k8s cluster with the existing token and
run benchmark test.
gpu_benchmark_with_cluster (~300s): Run the benchmark test with existing GPU cluster.
