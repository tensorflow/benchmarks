  """An image producer that puts images into a staging area periodically.

  This class is useful for periodically running a set of ops, `put_ops` on a
  different thread every `batch_group_size` times.

  The notify_image_consumption() method is used to increment an internal counter
  so that when it is first called, `put_ops` is executed. Afterwards, every
  `batch_group_size` times notify_image_consumption() is called,
  `put_ops` is executed again. A barrier is placed so that the main thread is
  blocked until `put_ops` have been executed.

  The start() method is used to start the thread that runs `put_ops`.

  The done() method waits until the last put_ops is executed and stops the
  thread.

  The purpose of this class is to fill an image input pipeline every
  `batch_group_size` steps. Suppose `put_ops` supplies M images to the input
  pipeline when run, and that every step, (M/`batch_group_size`) images are
  consumed. Then, by calling notify_image_consumption() every step, images are
  supplied to the input pipeline at the same amount they are consumed.
