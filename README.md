# TensorFlow benchmarks
This repository contains various TensorFlow benchmarks. Currently, it consists of two projects:


1. [PerfZero](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/perfzero): A benchmark framework for TensorFlow.

2. [scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) (no longer maintained): The TensorFlow CNN benchmarks contain TensorFlow 1 benchmarks for several convolutional neural networks.

If you want to run TensorFlow models and measure their performance, also consider the [TensorFlow Official Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official)
